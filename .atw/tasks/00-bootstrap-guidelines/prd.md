# Bootstrap Task: Fill Project Development Guidelines

**You (the AI) are running this task. The developer does not read this file.**

The developer just ran `atw init` on this project for the first time.
`.atw/` now exists with empty spec scaffolding, and this bootstrap task
exists under `.atw/tasks/`. When they want to work on it, they should start
this task from a session that provides ATW session identity.

**Your job**: help them populate `.atw/spec/` with the team's real
coding conventions. Every future AI session — the `/atw-implement` run
and this project's `atw-review` sub-agents — reads spec files
listed in per-task jsonl manifests. Empty spec = the AI writes generic
code. Real spec = the AI matches the team's actual patterns.

Don't dump instructions. Open with a short greeting, figure out if the repo
has any existing convention docs (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, etc.), and drive
the rest conversationally.

## Spec files to populate

### Frontend guidelines

| File                                         | What to document                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `.atw/spec/frontend/directory-structure.md`  | Component/page/hook organization          |
| `.atw/spec/frontend/component-guidelines.md` | Component patterns, props conventions     |
| `.atw/spec/frontend/hook-guidelines.md`      | Custom hook naming, patterns              |
| `.atw/spec/frontend/state-management.md`     | State library, patterns, what goes where  |
| `.atw/spec/frontend/type-safety.md`          | TypeScript conventions, type organization |
| `.atw/spec/frontend/quality-guidelines.md`   | Linting, testing, accessibility           |

### Thinking guides (already populated)

`.atw/spec/guides/` contains general thinking guides pre-filled with
best practices. Customize only if something clearly doesn't fit this project.

## How to fill the spec

### Step 1: Import from existing convention files first (preferred)

Search the repo for existing convention docs. If any exist, read them and
extract the relevant rules into the matching `.atw/spec/` files —
usually much faster than documenting from scratch.

| File / Directory                                                            | Tool                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `CLAUDE.md` / `CLAUDE.local.md`                                             | Claude Code                                  |
| `AGENTS.md`                                                                 | Codex / Claude Code / agent-compatible tools |
| `.cursorrules`                                                              | Cursor                                       |
| `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`                                                       | Cursor (rules directory)                     |
| `.windsurfrules`                                                            | Windsurf                                     |
| `.clinerules`                                                               | Cline                                        |
| `.roomodes`                                                                 | Roo Code                                     |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md`                                           | GitHub Copilot                               |

| `.editorconfig`                                                             | Editor formatting rules                      |

### Step 2: Analyze the codebase for anything not covered by existing docs

Scan real code to discover patterns. Before writing each spec file:

- Find 2-3 real examples of each pattern in the codebase.
- Reference real file paths (not hypothetical ones).
- Document anti-patterns the team clearly avoids.

### Step 3: Document reality, not ideals

**Critical**: write what the code _actually does_, not what it should do.
Sub-agents match the spec, so aspirational patterns that don't exist in the
codebase will cause sub-agents to write code that looks out of place.

If the team has known tech debt, document the current state — improvement
is a separate conversation, not a bootstrap concern.

## Quick explainer of the runtime (share when they ask "why do we need spec at all")

- Every ticket runs through `/atw-implement` in the main session (writes
  code), which dispatches two `atw-review` sub-agents (verify quality).
  No implementation sub-agent is spawned.
- Each task has `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl` manifests listing which
  spec files to load.
- The platform hook auto-injects those spec files + the task's `prd.md`
  into every sub-agent prompt, so the sub-agent codes/reviews per team
  conventions without anyone pasting them manually.
- Source of truth: `.atw/spec/`. That's why filling it well now pays
  off forever.

## Completion

When the developer confirms the checklist items above are done with real
examples (not placeholders), guide them to run:

```bash
python3 ./.atw/scripts/task.py finish
python3 ./.atw/scripts/task.py archive 00-bootstrap-guidelines
```

After archive, every new developer who joins this project will get a
`00-join-<slug>` onboarding task instead of this bootstrap task.

## Suggested opening line

"Welcome to ATW! Your init just set me up to help you fill the project
spec — a one-time setup so every future AI session follows the team's
conventions instead of writing generic code. Before we start, do you have
any existing convention docs (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, CONTRIBUTING.md,
etc.) I can pull from, or should I scan the codebase from scratch?"
