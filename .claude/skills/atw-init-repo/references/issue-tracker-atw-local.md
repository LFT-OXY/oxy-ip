# Issue tracker: ATW task directory (local only)

This repo tracks work in the ATW task system. All issues — the spec and the implementation tickets for the task you are working on — live as markdown files in the current ATW task directory. There is no remote mirror: the task directory is the **sole authority**, and nothing is synced anywhere.

## Resolving the current task directory

Every path below is relative to the active task. Resolve it first:

```bash
TASK=$(python3 .atw/scripts/task.py current)
```

Bare `current` prints the repo-relative task directory. It **exits non-zero when there is no active task** — when that happens, stop and ask the user to create or start one. Do not fall back to `.scratch/`.

## Conventions

- **Spec**: `$TASK/prd.md`. Write the whole file; the skeleton `task.py create` wrote is meant to be overwritten. ATW treats the file as opaque text and parses nothing inside it.
- **Implementation tickets**: one file per ticket at `$TASK/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01` in dependency order.
- **Research notes**: `$TASK/research/<topic>.md`, one file per topic.
- **Triage state**: not used on tickets in the task directory — see the `Status:` note below.
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom of the ticket file under a `## Comments` heading.

## Ticket file fields

On top of the standard ticket template, tickets here carry one extra line:

```markdown
# 01 — Ticket title

**What to build:** the end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work.

**Blocked by:** None
**Status:** ready-for-agent
**Impl:** ready
```

| Field     | Vocabulary                            | Who writes it                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Status:` | triage roles (see `triage-labels.md`) | Fixed at `ready-for-agent`. These tickets are ones you sliced yourself, so they never need triage — the field is a placeholder kept for vocabulary compatibility. |
| `Impl:`   | `ready` / `doing` / `done`            | `tickets.py`. This is the field the workflow actually routes on, and the only field the parser requires.                                                          |

The ticket template `tickets.py` writes also carries an empty `**Issue:**` line. It is meaningless in this variant — nothing fills it in — and `tickets.py` never reads it. Leave it or delete it; neither breaks anything.

`Status:` and `Impl:` are deliberately separate. `Status:` answers "is this ticket clear enough, and who should pick it up"; `Impl:` answers "how far along is it". Folding implementation progress into `Status:` puts three unrelated vocabularies in one slot.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

| Artifact               | Destination                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| A spec                 | `$TASK/prd.md`                |
| Implementation tickets | `$TASK/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md` |

The files **are** the tracker — there is no sync step and no remote to publish to.

Do not apply a triage label when publishing here; these artifacts don't enter the triage queue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

- A number like `01` or a filename → read `$TASK/issues/<NN>-*.md`.
- No reference given → `python3 .atw/scripts/tickets.py frontier` and take the ticket currently at `Impl: doing`, or the first frontier ticket if none is claimed.

## Ticket operations

```bash
python3 .atw/scripts/tickets.py list        # all tickets + Impl state
python3 .atw/scripts/tickets.py frontier    # Impl: ready with all blockers done
python3 .atw/scripts/tickets.py claim <NN>  # → Impl: doing
python3 .atw/scripts/tickets.py done <NN>   # → Impl: done
```

`claim` refuses tickets that aren't on the frontier, and the parser rejects blocker references that don't exist or form a cycle. `claim` also records `implementation_base_sha` and writes the ticket's path into `$TASK/check.jsonl`, which is what review sub-agents read to know which ticket is live; `done` withdraws that line.

**Tickets run one at a time by default.** `claim` hard-rejects a second ticket while another is at `Impl: doing`, but that check is read-then-write — it is serial execution, not an atomic exclusive claim. Don't run two implementers against one task directory.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `atw-map`. A map is a **discover-phase** artifact and lives in the task directory alongside everything else.

- **Map**: `$TASK/map.md` — the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body.
- **Child ticket**: `$TASK/map-issues/NN-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, with the question in the body. A `Type:` line records the ticket type (`research`/`prototype`/`interview`/`task`); a `Status:` line records `claimed`/`resolved`.
- **Blocking**: a `Blocked by: NN, NN` line near the top. A ticket is unblocked when every file it lists is `resolved`.
- **Frontier**: scan `$TASK/map-issues/` for files that are open, unblocked, and unclaimed; first by number wins.
- **Claim**: set `Status: claimed` and save before any work.
- **Resolve**: append the answer under an `## Answer` heading, set `Status: resolved`, then append a context pointer to Decisions-so-far in `map.md`.

Decision tickets live in `map-issues/`, **not** `issues/`. They are questions whose resolution is a decision; `issues/` holds slices of a build to execute. They use different state vocabularies (`claimed`/`resolved` vs `Impl:`), and `tickets.py` only reads `issues/`. Mixing them makes the frontier calculation wrong in both directions.

## What is _not_ tracked here

These stay at the repo root, unchanged:

```text
docs/adr/          architecture decisions          atw-domain-modeling
CONTEXT.md         domain glossary                 atw-domain-modeling
.out-of-scope/     rejected-concept records        atw-triage
.atw/spec/         layered coding standards        ATW's own spec flow
```

They outlive any single task, so they don't belong in a directory that gets archived.

## Re-enabling the GitHub mirror

The mirror machinery ships with ATW, switched off. `.atw/scripts/github_sync.py` works; nothing calls it. Turning the mirror on means wiring it yourself in two places — there is no commented-out block to uncomment, so check your work against the commands given here.

1. **`.atw/config.yaml`** — add a `hooks:` block. The file ships with a commented example that shows the shape but no sync wiring:

   ```yaml
   hooks:
     after_create:
       - "python3 .atw/scripts/github_sync.py create"
     after_archive:
       - "python3 .atw/scripts/github_sync.py archive"
   ```

   `task.py` sets `TASK_JSON_PATH` for you on the hook path, so these two need no environment prefix. Verify with `grep -n -A 6 "^hooks:" .atw/config.yaml` — you should see your two entries with no leading `#`.

2. **`.atw/workflow.md`** — add the sync steps as phase completion conditions: `github_sync.py sync-spec` when the spec is written, `github_sync.py sync-tickets` when the tickets are sliced. Both are explicit commands, not hooks — ATW fires lifecycle hooks only on task create / start / finish / archive, and **there is no event for "a file was written"**. They take the `TASK_JSON_PATH=$TASK/task.json` prefix, because nothing sets it for you outside the hook path.

3. **Replace this file** with the "ATW task directory + GitHub" variant, which documents the sync steps and the `**Issue:**` ticket field the sync fills in. The seed template ships inside the `atw-init-repo` skill folder as `references/issue-tracker-atw.md`; locate it with:

   ```bash
   find -L . -name "issue-tracker-atw.md" -not -path "./.git/*"
   ```

   The `-L` matters: skill folders are often symlinked between `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/`, and a bare `find` walks past symlinked directories without descending into them, so it reports only one of the two paths.

Historic tasks need no back-fill — from then on, `create` assigns each new task a fresh remote issue.

## Why this variant exists

Choosing the ATW task directory as the tracker does not have to mean choosing GitHub. This file covers the case where the task directory is all there is: a repo with no remote, a private/solo project, or a team that keeps planning artifacts out of the issue tracker on purpose.

Nothing here is a degraded version of the mirrored variant — the task directory was already the authority in that one too. The only thing removed is the outbound copy.
