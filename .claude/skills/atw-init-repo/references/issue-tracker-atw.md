# Issue tracker: ATW task directory + GitHub

This repo tracks work in the ATW task system. Work is split across two places, and which one you use depends on **who raised the item**:

| What                                                                    | Where                          | Who triages it                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Issues and PRs other people raised                                      | GitHub Issues (`gh` CLI)       | `atw-triage` runs here                         |
| The spec and implementation tickets for the task you are working on now | The current ATW task directory | Nobody — these are agent-ready by construction |

The task directory is the **authority**. Its contents are synced one-way out to GitHub as a mirror; never edit the mirror and expect it to come back.

## Resolving the current task directory

Every path below is relative to the active task. Resolve it first:

```bash
TASK=$(python3 .atw/scripts/task.py current)
```

Bare `current` prints the repo-relative task directory. It **exits non-zero when there is no active task** — when that happens, stop and ask the user to create or start one. Do not fall back to `.scratch/`.

## Conventions

- **Spec**: `$TASK/prd.md`. Write the whole file; the skeleton `task.py create` wrote is meant to be overwritten. ATW treats the file as opaque text and parses nothing inside it.
- **Implementation tickets**: one file per ticket at `$TASK/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01` in dependency order.
- **Research notes**: `$TASK/research/<topic>.md`, one file per topic.
- **Triage state**: not used on tickets in the task directory — see the `Status:` note below.
- Comments and conversation history live on the mirrored GitHub issue, not in the file.

## Ticket file fields

On top of the standard ticket template, tickets here carry two extra lines:

```markdown
# 01 — Ticket title

**What to build:** the end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work.

**Blocked by:** None
**Status:** ready-for-agent
**Impl:** ready
**Issue:**
```

| Field     | Vocabulary                            | Who writes it                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Status:` | triage roles (see `triage-labels.md`) | Fixed at `ready-for-agent`. These tickets are ones you sliced yourself, so they never need triage — the field is a placeholder kept for vocabulary compatibility. |
| `Impl:`   | `ready` / `doing` / `done`            | `tickets.py`. This is the field the workflow actually routes on, and the only field the parser requires.                                                          |
| `Issue:`  | `#58`, or empty                       | Filled in by `github_sync.py sync-tickets`; it is also the only ticket ↔ remote-issue mapping, so there is no separate mapping table.                             |

`Status:` and `Impl:` are deliberately separate. `Status:` answers "is this ticket clear enough, and who should pick it up"; `Impl:` answers "how far along is it". Folding implementation progress into `Status:` puts three unrelated vocabularies in one slot.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

| Artifact               | Destination                   | Then                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A spec                 | `$TASK/prd.md`                | `TASK_JSON_PATH=$TASK/task.json python3 .atw/scripts/github_sync.py sync-spec`    |
| Implementation tickets | `$TASK/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md` | `TASK_JSON_PATH=$TASK/task.json python3 .atw/scripts/github_sync.py sync-tickets` |

ATW fires lifecycle hooks only on task create / start / finish / archive — **there is no event for "a file was written"**, so the sync step above is something you run, not something that happens for you. It exits non-zero when it can't sync, because you asked for it explicitly; the `create` / `archive` hook path warns and exits 0 instead, so a sync failure never blocks creating or archiving a task.

Do not apply a triage label when publishing here; these artifacts don't enter the triage queue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

- A number like `01` or a filename → read `$TASK/issues/<NN>-*.md`.
- A `#NN` GitHub reference → `gh issue view <NN>`. If it mirrors a local ticket, prefer the local file — that's the authority.
- No reference given → `python3 .atw/scripts/tickets.py frontier` and take the ticket currently at `Impl: doing`, or the first frontier ticket if none is claimed.

## Ticket operations

```bash
python3 .atw/scripts/tickets.py list        # all tickets + Impl state
python3 .atw/scripts/tickets.py frontier    # Impl: ready with all blockers done
python3 .atw/scripts/tickets.py claim <NN>  # → Impl: doing
python3 .atw/scripts/tickets.py done <NN>   # → Impl: done
```

`claim` refuses tickets that aren't on the frontier, and the parser rejects blocker references that don't exist or form a cycle. `claim` also records `implementation_base_sha` and writes the ticket's path into `$TASK/check.jsonl`, which is what review sub-agents read to know which ticket is live; `done` withdraws that line.

**Tickets run one at a time by default.** `claim` hard-rejects a second ticket while another is at `Impl: doing`, but that check is read-then-write — it is serial execution, not an atomic exclusive claim. Don't run two implementers against one task directory.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `atw-map`. A map is a **discover-phase** artifact and lives in the task directory alongside everything else.

- **Map**: `$TASK/map.md` — the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body.
- **Child ticket**: `$TASK/map-issues/NN-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, with the question in the body. A `Type:` line records the ticket type (`research`/`prototype`/`interview`/`task`); a `Status:` line records `claimed`/`resolved`.
- **Blocking**: a `Blocked by: NN, NN` line near the top. A ticket is unblocked when every file it lists is `resolved`.
- **Frontier**: scan `$TASK/map-issues/` for files that are open, unblocked, and unclaimed; first by number wins.
- **Claim**: set `Status: claimed` and save before any work.
- **Resolve**: append the answer under an `## Answer` heading, set `Status: resolved`, then append a context pointer to Decisions-so-far in `map.md`.

Decision tickets live in `map-issues/`, **not** `issues/`. They are questions whose resolution is a decision; `issues/` holds slices of a build to execute. They use different state vocabularies (`claimed`/`resolved` vs `Impl:`), and `tickets.py` only reads `issues/`. Mixing them makes the frontier calculation wrong in both directions.

Map child tickets are not synced to GitHub — they are working notes for one effort's discover phase, and they resolve fast.

## What is _not_ tracked here

These stay at the repo root, unchanged:

```text
docs/adr/          architecture decisions          atw-domain-modeling
CONTEXT.md         domain glossary                 atw-domain-modeling
.out-of-scope/     rejected-concept records        atw-triage
.atw/spec/         layered coding standards        ATW's own spec flow
```

They outlive any single task, so they don't belong in a directory that gets archived.
