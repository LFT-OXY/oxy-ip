# Local Files Generated After Init

`atw init` writes the ATW runtime into the user project. Later, `atw update` tries to update ATW-managed template files, but it uses `.atw/.template-hashes.json` to determine which files have already been modified by the user.

This page only describes files that are visible and editable inside the user project.

| Path                         | Usually editable? | Notes                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.atw/workflow.md`           | Yes               | Local workflow documentation and AI routing rules.                                 |
| `.atw/config.yaml`           | Yes               | Project configuration, hooks, packages, journal line limits, and related settings. |
| `.atw/spec/`                 | Yes               | Project specs, intended to be updated regularly by users and AI.                   |
| `.atw/tasks/`                | Yes               | Task material and research artifacts, maintained by the task workflow.             |
| `.atw/workspace/`            | Yes               | Session records, usually written by `add_session.py`.                              |
| `.atw/scripts/`              | Carefully         | Local runtime. It can be customized, but only after understanding the call chain.  |
| `.atw/.runtime/`             | No                | Runtime state, usually written automatically by hooks/scripts.                     |
| `.atw/.developer`            | Carefully         | Current developer identity.                                                        |
| `.atw/.version`              | No                | ATW version record used by update/migration logic.                                 |
| `.atw/.template-hashes.json` | No                | Template hash record. Do not hand-write business rules here.                       |

## Platform Directories

Different platforms generate different directories. Common categories:

| Category                   | Example paths                                                                            | Purpose                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| hooks                      | `.claude/hooks/`, `.codex/hooks/`, `.cursor/hooks/`                                      | Inject session context, workflow-state, and sub-agent context. |
| settings                   | `.claude/settings.json`, `.codex/hooks.json`, `.qoder/settings.json`, `.trae/hooks.json` | Tell the platform when to run hooks or plugins.                |
| agents                     | `.claude/agents/`, `.codex/agents/`, `.kiro/agents/`, `.zcode/agents/`                   | Define agents such as `atw-review` and `atw-implement-agent`.  |
| skills                     | `.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, `.qoder/skills/`, `.zcode/skills/`                 | Skills that auto-trigger or can be read by AI.                 |
| commands/prompts/workflows | `.cursor/commands/`, `.github/prompts/`, `.devin/workflows/`, `.zcode/commands/`         | Explicit user-invoked command or workflow entry points.        |

When modifying a platform directory, also confirm whether `.atw/workflow.md` still describes the same flow.

## Meaning Of Template Hashes

`.atw/.template-hashes.json` records the content hash from the last time ATW wrote a template file. `atw update` uses it to distinguish three cases:

| Case                                 | Update behavior                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| File was not modified by the user    | It can be updated automatically.                                       |
| File was modified by the user        | Prompt the user to overwrite, keep, or generate `.new`.                |
| File is no longer a current template | It may be deleted, renamed, or preserved according to migration rules. |

When an AI customizes local ATW files, it does not need to maintain hashes manually. It is normal for ATW update to recognize the result as "modified by the user."

## Local Customization Boundaries

Editable by default:

- `.atw/workflow.md`
- `.atw/config.yaml`
- `.atw/spec/**`
- `.atw/scripts/**`
- Platform hooks, settings, agents, skills, commands, prompts, and workflows

Do not edit by default:

- Global npm install directory
- `node_modules/@chinhae/atw-cli`
- ATW GitHub repository source code
- Concrete state files under `.atw/.runtime/**`
- Hash contents inside `.atw/.template-hashes.json`

Switch to the ATW CLI source-code perspective only when the user explicitly wants to contribute upstream.
