# Local Customization Overview

This directory is for local AI working in a user project where ATW was installed through npm and `atw init` has already been run. The AI should modify generated `.atw/` and platform directories inside the project, not ATW CLI upstream source code.

## First Determine What The User Actually Wants To Change

| User wording                                        | Read first                         |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| "Change the ATW flow / phases / next prompt"        | `change-workflow.md`               |
| "Change task creation, status, archive, or hooks"   | `change-task-lifecycle.md`         |
| "AI did not read context / change injected content" | `change-context-loading.md`        |
| "A platform hook is not behaving as expected"       | `change-hooks.md`                  |
| "Change implement/check/research agent behavior"    | `change-agents.md`                 |
| "Add a skill/command/workflow/prompt"               | `change-skills-or-commands.md`     |
| "Adjust the project spec structure"                 | `change-spec-structure.md`         |
| "Add team conventions and local notes"              | `add-project-local-conventions.md` |

## General Operation Order

1. **Confirm platform and directories**: inspect which directories exist, such as `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.cursor/`, `.zcode/`.
2. **Confirm the current active task**: run `python3 ./.atw/scripts/task.py current --source`.
3. **Read the local source of truth**: prefer `.atw/workflow.md`, `.atw/config.yaml`, and relevant platform files.
4. **Modify narrowly**: edit only files related to the user's request.
5. **Synchronize semantics**: if a shared flow changes, check whether platform entry points also need changes; if a platform entry changes, check whether `.atw/workflow.md` still agrees.

## Local File Priority

| Layer                 | Files                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workflow              | `.atw/workflow.md`                                                                  |
| Project configuration | `.atw/config.yaml`                                                                  |
| Task material         | `.atw/tasks/<task>/`                                                                |
| Project specs         | `.atw/spec/`                                                                        |
| Runtime scripts       | `.atw/scripts/`                                                                     |
| Platform integration  | `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.cursor/`, `.opencode/`, `.zcode/`, and similar directories |
| Shared skill          | `.agents/skills/`                                                                   |

## Things Not To Do By Default

- Do not edit the global npm install directory.
- Do not edit `node_modules/@chinhae/atw-cli`.
- Do not assume the user has the ATW GitHub repository.
- Do not overwrite local files already modified by the user with default templates.
- Do not put team project rules into public `atw-meta`; project rules belong in `.atw/spec/` or a local skill.

## When To Inspect Upstream Source

Switch to an upstream source-code perspective only when the user explicitly expresses one of these goals:

- "I want to open a PR to ATW"
- "I want to change npm package publish contents"
- "I want to fork ATW"
- "I want to modify the generation logic for `atw init/update`"

Otherwise, default to modifying local ATW files inside the user project.
